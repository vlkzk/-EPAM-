That's me.
Phenomenal woman,
Phenomenally.
'Cause I'm a woman
The need of my care,
the palm of my hand,
The bend of my hair,
It's in the click of my heels,
I say,
It ought to make you proud.
When you see me passing
Or have to talk real loud.
I don't shout or jump about
Just why my head's not bowed.
Now you understand

That's me.
Phenomenal woman,
Phenomenally.

I'm a woman
The grace of my style.
The ride of my breasts,
The sun of my smile,
It's in the arch of my back,
I say,
They say they still can't see.
When I try to show them
My inner mystery.
But they can't touch
They try so much
What they see in me.
Men themselves have wondered

That's me.
Phenomenal woman,
Phenomenally.
I'm a woman
And the joy in my feet.
The swing in my waist,
And the flash of my teeth,
It's the fire in my eyes,
I say,
A hive of honey bees.
Then they swarm around me,
Fall down on their knees.
The fellows stand or
And to a man,
Just as cool as you please,
I walk into a room

That's me.
Phenomenal woman,
Phenomenally.
I'm a woman
The curl of my lips.
The stride of my step,
The span of my hips,
It's in the reach of my arms
I say,
They think I'm telling lies.
But when I start to tell them,
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
